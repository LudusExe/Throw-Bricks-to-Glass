# Throw Bricks To Glass

This mod lets players throw bricks at glass to break it.

## Features

* Players can throw bricks (`mcl_core:brick` and `default:clay_brick`) and nether bricks (`mcl_nether:netherbrick`).
* If the brick hits a breakable glass block, the glass will shatter.
* If nothing is hit, the brick falls to the ground and can be picked up.
* Supported glass types include:

  * Regular and stained glass (`mcl_core`)
  * Tinted glass (`mcl_amethyst:tinted_glass`)
  * Window panes (`xpanes`) and (`mcl_panes`)
